Let's brainstorm the architecture for handling session-specific behavior, particularly in the context of supporting multiple simultaneous users on the server.

### Key Components to Consider

1. **Session-specific resources**:
   - **AudioPlayer**: Each session needs its own instance of the `AudioPlayer` to manage files and playback uniquely.
   - **Processing Queue**: The queue that manages audio files and processes them with WhisperX (potentially renamed to `ProcessWhisperQueue`) should also be session-specific to ensure that files from one session do not mix with files from another.
   - **FileCreationHandler**: This handler currently observes file creation events. Making it session-specific ensures that files related to one session trigger appropriate behavior without interference from other sessions.

### **Session-Specific Components and Behavior**

#### 1. **AudioPlayer**:
   - **Session-specific Instantiation**: Each user session should instantiate its own `AudioPlayer` to manage session-specific audio files and playback.
   - **Concurrency**: The `AudioPlayer` instance must handle multiple actions (play, pause) simultaneously for different users. This could mean running the `AudioPlayer` in a thread or task for each session.
   
   **Considerations**:
   - Use a separate instance per session to isolate state (e.g., current time, file being played).
   - Manage concurrency through threads, background tasks, or async handling for each `AudioPlayer`.

#### 2. **Processing Queue** (e.g., `ProcessWhisperQueue`):
   - **Session-specific Queue**: Each session should have its own queue. The queue will manage files that need processing for that specific session.
   - **Concurrency and Scalability**: Processing WhisperX can be CPU-bound, so it may be necessary to offload this work to background threads or worker processes, ensuring that one session's heavy processing doesn't block another.
   
   **Considerations**:
   - Each session could have its own processing task or thread to ensure independence between users.
   - Limit how many files are queued or processed at the same time to avoid overloading the server.

#### 3. **FileCreationHandler**:
   - **Session-specific Event Handling**: Each session’s `FileCreationHandler` should observe only files related to that session, such as files that match the session’s unique file prefix.
   - **Concurrency**: Multiple `FileCreationHandler` instances may be running simultaneously, one for each session. This should be managed without race conditions or resource contention.

   **Considerations**:
   - Each session should have its own `Observer` that watches for changes in the temp file directory for files that belong to the session (files could be named with a session-specific prefix).
   - Handle concurrency with locks or async mechanisms to ensure that one session's event handling doesn't interfere with others.

### **Session Management and Concurrency**

#### **Session Creation and Lifecycle**:
1. **Create Instances on Session Start**:
   - When a session is initiated (e.g., when a user starts interacting with the API), create session-specific instances of the following:
     - `AudioPlayer`
     - `ProcessWhisperQueue`
     - `FileCreationHandler`

2. **Session ID Prefix**:
   - Use the session ID as a prefix for all temporary files created during the session. This ensures that the files are properly tied to each session and are processed by the correct session-specific components.
   
3. **Track Active Sessions**:
   - Use a dictionary to store active sessions, mapping the `session_id` to its associated resources (e.g., `AudioPlayer`, `ProcessWhisperQueue`, and `FileCreationHandler`).
   - Upon session start, create and store the relevant session-specific instances in the dictionary. When the session ends, clean up the resources.

#### **Handling Multiple Sessions Simultaneously**:
- **Concurrency Handling**: 
   - Since multiple sessions will be active at once, and some of the tasks (like WhisperX processing) are CPU-bound, it's important to ensure that the server can process multiple tasks in parallel without blocking.
   - You can achieve this by using:
     - **Threading**: If WhisperX is CPU-bound, running each session’s queue processing in a separate thread can help.
     - **Async Tasks**: If the task is more I/O-bound (e.g., waiting for file creation), using async tasks could suffice.
     - **Multiprocessing**: If you expect significant CPU usage, multiprocessing can be considered for isolating WhisperX tasks.

- **Locks for Shared Resources**: 
   - Any shared resource between sessions (e.g., file directories) should be protected by locks or async-safe mechanisms to prevent race conditions.

### **File Creation Handling**

- **Session-Specific Observers**:
   - Each session should have its own `Observer` for file creation that watches for files prefixed by the session ID in the temp directory.
   - This ensures that only files related to the session are processed, and different sessions don't handle each other's files.

- **Concurrency**: 
   - If multiple observers are running at the same time, care should be taken to handle concurrency efficiently. Multiple observers can coexist as long as they handle their own session-specific events.

---

### **Behavior Flow for Multiple Users**

1. **Session Start**:
   - When a user initiates a session (e.g., starts a video/audio interaction):
     - Create a session-specific `AudioPlayer`.
     - Create a session-specific `ProcessWhisperQueue` (queue to handle audio file processing for WhisperX).
     - Create a session-specific `FileCreationHandler` that observes the file system for new files created by that session.

2. **File Processing**:
   - Each session has its own queue and observer. When a file is created, it is added to the session's queue for processing.
   - WhisperX processing happens in the background for each session independently, ensuring that CPU-bound tasks for one user do not block others.

3. **Concurrency Handling**:
   - Multiple sessions can be active simultaneously, and each session processes files independently using threads or background tasks.
   - Care is taken to avoid race conditions on shared resources.

4. **Session Cleanup**:
   - When a session ends (e.g., user finishes or leaves), clean up the resources:
     - Stop the session's `AudioPlayer`.
     - Clear and stop the session's `ProcessWhisperQueue`.
     - Stop the file observer for that session.

### **Summary of Decisions to Make**:

- **Session-Specific `AudioPlayer`**: Each session needs its own instance, as it handles session-specific state (like file creation and playback).
- **Session-Specific `ProcessWhisperQueue`**: Each session should have its own queue to handle file processing independently. This isolates WhisperX tasks and prevents interference between users.
- **Session-Specific `FileCreationHandler`**: Each session should have its own file observer that watches for files related to that session.
- **Concurrency**: Handle concurrency with threads or async tasks to ensure smooth processing for multiple simultaneous users.
